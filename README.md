# Stock Data Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and data for a stock data prediction project. The project involves analyzing historical stock data, training machine learning models, and making predictions on future stock prices.

## Files and Folders

The repository includes the following files and folders:

- `first.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code and analysis for the project.
- `Stock_price.csv`: Dataset in CSV format containing historical stock data, including columns like 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', etc.
- `results.csv`: CSV file containing the evaluation metric of the predictions made by the machine learning models on the test data.
- `graphs/`: Folder containing several graphs and visualizations generated during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model evaluation stages. The graphs are saved as .png files.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical stock data. We preprocess the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, and then train various machine learning models for regression. The models are evaluated using common regression evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results

The project aims to achieve accurate predictions of stock prices based on historical data. The evaluation metrics and visualizations in the notebook will provide insights into the model's performance and how well it generalizes to unseen data.
